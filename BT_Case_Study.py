Case Study: Walmart's Blockchain for Mangoes
Introduction:

   Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers, has implemented a blockchain application to track the
journey of mangoes from farm to store shelves. This simple example illustrates the use of blockchain
to improve transparency and traceability in the food supply chain.
  
Background:
  
   Walmart recognized the need for greater transparency in its supply chain, especially for fresh
produce like mangoes. Traditional supply chain systems made it challenging to quickly trace the
source of a food safety issue.
  
Key Objectives:

1. Supply Chain Transparency: Walmart aimed to provide customers with information about the
origin of the mangoes, allowing them to make informed choices.
2. Traceability: The retailer sought to trace the journey of each mango, making it easier to identify
and respond to any food safety issues.
How it Works:

Walmart's blockchain for mangoes operates as follows:
  
1. Data Entry: When mangoes are harvested, data about their origin, handling, and transportation is
recorded on the blockchain.
2. Real-time Access: At Walmart stores, customers can scan a QR code on a mango to access
information about where it was grown and its journey to the store.
  
Case Example:

Imagine a customer shopping at a Walmart store. They pick up a mango and scan the QR code using
their smartphone. The blockchain-based system instantly provides information about the mango's
origin, the date it was harvested, and the various points it passed through before reaching the store.
  
Outcomes:
  
The implementation of blockchain for mangoes at Walmart has had several positive outcomes:
1. Improved Transparency: Customers can access information about the mangoes they purchase,
fostering trust.
2. Traceability: In case of a food safety issue, Walmart can quickly trace the source of the issue,
allowing for targeted recalls and reduced food waste.
3. Enhanced Customer Confidence: Shoppers are more confident in the freshness and quality of the
produce they buy.
  
Conclusion:
  
Walmart's blockchain for mangoes is a straightforward yet effective example of how blockchain
technology can be applied to improve transparency and traceability in a supply chain. By providing
customers with access to information about the products they purchase, Walmart enhances trust
and confidence, while also improving its ability to respond to food safety concerns. This example
shows that blockchain technology can be implemented in a practical and user-friendly manner,
providing benefits to both businesses and consumers.
