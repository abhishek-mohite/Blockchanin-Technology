Survey Report on Types of Blockchains

Introduction:

Blockchain technology has gained widespread attention and adoption in recent years due to its
potential to revolutionize various industries. Blockchains are distributed ledger systems that offer
transparency, security, and decentralization. There are different types of blockchains, each with its
unique characteristics and use cases. This survey report aims to provide an overview of the various
types of blockchains, including public, private, and consortium blockchains, and permissioned and
permissionless blockchains.
  
Public Blockchains

Public blockchains are open and decentralized networks where anyone can participate, view the
entire ledger, and validate transactions. The most common examples of public blockchains are
Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  
Advantages:
  
1. Decentralization: No central authority controls the network, making it resistant to censorship.
2. Security: High level of security due to widespread participation and cryptographic algorithms.
3. Transparency: Transactions are visible to anyone, promoting trust.
  
Disadvantages:
  
1. Scalability: Slower transaction speeds and higher fees due to the consensus mechanism.
2. Limited Privacy: Transactions are public, which can pose privacy concerns.
Private Blockchains
Private blockchains are restricted and centralized networks where access is granted to specific
participants. These blockchains are often used within organizations for various purposes, including
supply chain management and internal record-keeping.
  
Advantages:
  
1. Enhanced Privacy: Participants have more control over who can access the blockchain.
2. Scalability: Faster transaction speeds and lower fees due to centralized control.
3. Efficient Consensus: Less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms.
Disadvantages:
1. Centralization: Reduced decentralization can lead to a lack of trust.
2. Limited Transparency: Less transparency compared to public blockchains.

Consortium Blockchains

Consortium blockchains are a hybrid between public and private blockchains. A group of
organizations collaborates to control and maintain the network. Consortium blockchains are
common in industries where multiple parties need to work together, such as banking and
healthcare.
  
Advantages:
  
1. Collaboration: Multiple organizations can work together while maintaining control.
2. Enhanced Trust: Trust is established among the consortium members.
3. Regulatory Compliance: Easier compliance with industry regulations.
  
Disadvantages:
  
1. Limited Decentralization: The level of decentralization can vary.
2. Complexity: Managing multiple stakeholders can be complex.
  
Permissioned Blockchains

Permissioned blockchains require participants to be approved or invited to join the network. Access
control and governance are central features of these blockchains, ensuring only trusted entities can
participate.
  
Advantages:
  
1. Security: Increased security due to strict access controls.
2. Efficiency: Faster transaction processing and lower costs.
3. Regulatory Compliance: Easier compliance with legal requirements.
  
Disadvantages:
  
1. Centralization: Limited decentralization can reduce trust among participants.
2. Limited Inclusivity: Barriers to entry may exclude potential contributors.

Permissionless Blockchains

Permissionless blockchains are open to anyone, and participants do not require permission to join.
They rely on cryptographic mechanisms and decentralized consensus to validate transactions and
maintain the network.

Advantages:

1. Decentralization: A high degree of decentralization promotes trust.
2. Accessibility: Open to anyone, fostering inclusivity.
3. Transparency: Transactions are public and auditable.

Disadvantages:

1. Scalability: Slower transaction speeds and higher fees.
2. Security Concerns: Open access can make the network vulnerable to attacks.

Conclusion

Blockchains come in various types, each offering unique advantages and disadvantages. The choice
of blockchain type depends on the specific use case and requirements of the participants. Public,
private, consortium, permissioned, and permissionless blockchains each have their place in the
rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology. As the technology continues to mature,
understanding these blockchain types is essential for making informed decisions about their
adoption and implementation.
